- [ ] Metadata system where we can add whatever type of metadata/headers to notes as we want. This is for filtering and searching
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for searching, navigating, and creating notes
- [ ] Link to other notes by title
- [ ] Support for images

- [ ] Make sure we're consuming prisma in our server side props and api route correctly
- [ ] Validation for TEXT size
- [ ] Downloading Planetscale data locally in app for working offline and syncing with backend
- [ ] Maximum in-app performance. Everything should feel instant.

      CRUD
      Multi-select with actions
